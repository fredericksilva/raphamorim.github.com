I started using vim a little time, and I ended up in this period, left the Sublime Text and the Atom. I confess that I still use they when I want to use some peculiarity of the editors.

### Learning Curve

I felt the difference between vim and other editors in short time. The learning curve of vim is something to stand out. 

At the beginning, it is quite difficult, to be honest. You have to relearn everything about editors and loses the speed it had. But I kept using it. I was also forcing myself into improving my usage, reading about it and learning tricks.

Took me a while to get used to using vim's shortcuts. But i really like that, i've feel playing some game when i use "vim combos" in keyboard. Damn! This is really cool.

### Oh! you are really fast

Something that is very obvious is the speed of vim to open or edit some file. But vim isn't about speed, neither anything related with this. It's about practicality, with vim you can edit so fast any file/project using terminal. 

Now you need not wait for the editor to be able to open that little quick change to the file.

### Fully hackable

It is one of the few code editors allow you to configure shortcuts, syntax, text format and so much things. Being fully changeable.

Maybe the thing more cool i've did in this little time, was look for new shortcuts and tricks to my vimrc. I ended up seeing many vimrc from many awesome devs.

### Think more before do anything

At first things were more complicated, did not know many shortcuts. So had little speed to make anything small. I chose to think more on what was going to do.
